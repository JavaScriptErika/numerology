# Numerology

This was one of my first projects I created after vigorously learning about arrays. It was a fun algorithmic challenge, and I’d like to create similar projects to this in retrospect of its challenge.

The idea behind this program is to add together (individually) the numbers from a user’s input and output a single digit. If a user inputs 10, the program will reduce it down to 1 (1 + 0 = 1). The program will keep reducing until a single digit is achieved. From there, the program will tell the user the divine meaning behind their number.

My  goals are to refactor my code, add jQuery for tasteful effects, add content, and of course give it love in the HTML and CSS departments.
